# DeepMiner power mod for Stationeers.

# Description:  
Let's talk straight. Deep Miners are HUGELY unbalanced compared to other mining sources in Stationeers. To fix that, I made this simple mod to increase the power consumed by Deep Miners, to better balance them to other mining sources like Aimee and Rockets. Now Deep Miners need 5kw of power instead of 500w to operate.

# Instructions

* If you don't have BepInEx installed, download the lastest 5.x  64 bit version available at https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases and follow the BepInEx installation instructions but basically you will need to:
     - Drop it inside Stationeers folder
     - Start the game once to finish installing BepInEx and check if he created the folders called \Stationeers\BepInEx\plugins, if yes, the BepInEx installation is completed.
* Download the lastest release from the Releases page on Github.
* Unpack it inside the folder \BepInEx\plugins
* Start the game.
